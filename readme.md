## Debugging with VSCode

Make sure that have the chrome debugger extension installed. Then make sure that all the chrome instances are closed. Once Chrome is closed, first make sure that you are serving the files. Then, hit `F5` to start the debugger. Alternatively you can run the debugger from the debugger tab on the left side bar. The launch file is set up to open localhost:8080. You can configure this setting, it all depends how you are serving the project.
